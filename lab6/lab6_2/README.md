## Sonar Qube analysis

### Quality gate

The project passed the default quality gate, this means that all conditions established passed, if they didn't the measures to be taken in order to pass would appear. Because the default quality gate is new code, the first analysis would always pass.

| Code Smell (major) | A for loop stop condition should test the loop counter against an invariant value (i.e. one that is true at both the beginning and ending of every loop iteration). Ideally, this means that the stop condition is set to a local variable just before the loop begins.Stop conditions that are not invariant are slightly less efficient, as well as being difficult to understand and maintain, and likely lead to the introduction of errors in the future. |                                                                     Add i++ on the for condition                                                                      |
